Summary:

In the exam I found it pretty hard to figure out what the Task 1 visualization represented, so I wrote down all the indeces and solved the issue that way. Additionally, it was pretty challenging to create a JavaDoc file as I have no experience in dealing with them. AI tools helped me learn about JavaDoc and also helped overall with the coding process. Furthermore, AI made a beautiful HTML JavaDoc for me and I didn't have to spend time on that and focused on the Java code instead. However, when I tried to explain to AI that certain files and packages should not be renamed, as per the task instructions, it ignored my prompt and kept renaming them over and over.
